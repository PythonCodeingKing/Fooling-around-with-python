This is a readme file, so you probably want to know how my code works. Once again, feel free to leave a comment or an issue.
Also, I want project ideas to do, so feel free to leave those too.
You sould take a look at my code. First, after importing the librarys, it defines a function called main. You can do without main, but it makes the code neater and more readable.
If you don't know what a function is, It is a block of code that sits there doing nothing until called. You'll notice the last line. 
That is the function call. If you didn't include it, the code won't raise an error, but it won't do anything. You probably want to go to 
https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_functions.asp to learn more from pros.
Next, it starts a while loop to keep on sking for a seed until you enter '0000'(the break seed.change it to whatever you like)
The first thing in the while loop is a blank list. I'll explain it later.
